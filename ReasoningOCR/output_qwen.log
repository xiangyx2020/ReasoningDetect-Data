The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.
You have video processor config saved in `preprocessor.json` file which is deprecated. Video processor configs should be saved in their own `video_preprocessor.json` file. You can rename the file or load and save the processor back which renames it automatically. Loading from `preprocessor.json` will be removed in v5.0.
