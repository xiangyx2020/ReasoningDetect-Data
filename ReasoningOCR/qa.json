The task involves heating the food in two steps. The first step requires Peter to heat the food for 10 minutes using the highest power level available on the microwave. Following that, the second part of the task involves lowering the power level by five levels and continuing to heat the food for an additional 15 minutes. To complete this task, Peter would need to refer to the microwave oven operation guide shown in the picture, which lists the correct button sequences required to execute this operation. The question now asks: based on the operation guide, which specific button sequence should Peter press in order to successfully heat the food as per the remote command from its owner? The final result should be presented in the required format, which lists the sequence of button presses in the form of 'x, x, x, x..., and, x, x, x, x...'. For example, the button sequence for implementing the given example twice in picture is 'COOK TIME, 1, 5, 0, 0, POWER LEVEL, 5, START/+30Sec, and, COOK TIME, 1, 5, 0, 0, POWER LEVEL, 5, START/+30Sec'.",
