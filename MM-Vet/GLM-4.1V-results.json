Remember that when you take the square root, you have to consider both the positive and negative roots. So, \\(\\sqrt{(x + 3)^2} = \\sqrt{4}\\), which simplifies to \\(x + 3 = \\pm 2\\). That gives us two cases: one where \\(x + 3 = 2\\) and another where \\(x + 3 = -2\\). \n\nFor the first case, \\(x + 3 = 2\\), subtract 3 from both sides: \\(x = 2 - 3 = -1\\). For the second case, \\(x + 3 = -2\\), subtract 3 again: \\(x = -2 - 3 = -5\\). Let me check both solutions in the original equation to make sure they work. Plugging \\(x = -1\\) into \\((x + 3)^2\\), we get \\((-1 + 3)^2 = 2^2 = 4\\), which matches the right side. For \\(x = -5\\), \\((-5 + 3)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4\\), which also works.

        "response": "<think>Got it, let's solve the second equation, which is 7d - 4 = 11d - 9. First, I need to get all the d terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let's subtract 7d from both sides to start. That would give -4 = 4d - 9. Then, add 9 to both sides to get rid of the -9. So, -4 + 9 = 4d, which simplifies to 5 = 4d. Wait, wait, let me check that again. Wait, starting with 7d - 4 = 11d - 9. Subtract 7d from both sides: -4 = 4d - 9. Then add 9 to both sides: -4 + 9 = 4d, which is 5 = 4d? Wait, -4 + 9 is 5? Wait, no, -4 + 9 is 5? Wait, 9 minus 4 is 5, yes. Then divide both sides by 4: d = 5/4? Wait, wait, let me do it step by step again. Maybe move 11d to the left and -4 to the right. So subtract 11d from both sides: 7d - 11d - 4 = -9. That's -4d - 4 = -9. Then add 4 to both sides: -4d = -9 + 4 = -5. Then divide by -4: d = (-5)/(-4) = 5/4. Wait, or 1.25? Let me check the equation again. 7d - 4 = 11d - 9. Subtract 7d from both sides: -4 = 4d - 9. Add 9 to both sides: 5 = 4d. Then d = 5/4. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I do 11d - 7d = -4 + 9, which is 4d = 5, so d = 5/4. Yep, that's right.</think><answer>To solve the second equation \\(7d - 4 = 11d - 9\\), first subtract \\(7d\\) from both sides:  \n\\[\n-4 = 4d - 9\n\\]  \nThen add 9 to both sides:  \n\\[\n5 = 4d\n\\]  \nFinally, divide both sides by 4:  \n\\[\nd = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]  \nThe answer is \\(<|begin_of_box|>\\dfrac{5}{4}<|end_of_box|>\\).</answer>"
